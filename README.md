# Catalyst
This repository contains the code for the Catalyst App

## Synopsis
Catalyst is an app intended to create a community that shares their finds in sales in malls and outlets.
The app primarily has two functions. First is the user is able to take a picture of a sale and post
it to the. The second is that the user is able to search for sales based on area, price range, and
type of product.

## Motivation
The goal of this app is to create a community that shares their finds in sales in malls and outlets, helping each other out.
The story behind is the desire to better inform friends of in-store sales that are either unavailable or hard to find online.
As such, a successful community created from this app would be greatly helpful.
